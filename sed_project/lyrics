Steady callin’ my phone
I done told you before that it’s over, leave me ‘lone

Dark clouds, you gon’ see me storm

But trust me, you’re gon’ hold that
Hold that (Mmm, mmm)

And I’m sorry, but my feelings ain’t the same no more (No)
Used to be my homie, you ain’t gang no more (No)
I am not a person you could claim no more (No)
Traumatized, hoping it don’t rain no more
You done put me through some things, I done changed my aura
Now all around the world, I explore her, no Dora
New bands, I might drip out in Dior
Shawty phat, shawty straight heat, no Florida
Bad and she know it, for herself, I applaud her
No needs, yeah, I’m talkin’ my boo
So please, let me know when I’m through
And it’s all ’cause what’s true, shawty

Earthquake, make somethin’ shake, my love
Most of them can’t even relate, my love
Used to be gang, oh, now you’re not gang
Used to have fun, no, now you got shame
Used to catch flights, but now I’m not playin’
Play on words, she love it when a person sing
I ain’t tryna play your game no more
No, you can’t wear my chain no more
We are not a thing, can’t take no more
Waitin’ on your king, you could wait some more

Funny how this poop just flipped like a quarter
