I can’t
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mmm, mmm)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Yeah)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mind)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mind)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mmm, mmm) (Mind)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mind)
I can’t get you off my mind now (Mind)
Get you off my mind now (Mind)
Hold that (Mmm, mmm)
But trust me, you’re gon’ hold that (Hold that)
I won’t go back (I won’t go back)
Dark clouds, you gon’ see me storm
Know it’s hurtin’ you to see me gone
I done told you before that it’s over, leave me ‘lone (Yeah, yeah)
Steady callin’ my phone (Brrt)
Get a mood swing, I’ll be gone by tomorrow
Get a new thing, I’m a Fendi and Dior her (Mmm, mmm)
Funny how this poop just flipped like a quarter
Yeah, I remember days when I used to adore her
Waitin’ on your king, you could wait some more
We are not a thing, can’t take no more
No, you can’t wear my chain no more
I ain’t tryna play your game no more
Play on words, she love it when a person sing
Used to catch flights, but now I’m not playin’
Used to have fun, no, now you got shame
Used to be gang, oh, now you’re not gang
Most of them can’t even relate, my love
